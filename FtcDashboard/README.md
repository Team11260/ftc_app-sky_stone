This is the robot side of team 11260's java based FTC Dashboard for computer use. Features include:

- instant logging
- the ability to manipulate variables without code changes
- basic driver station functions so phone based DS is not necessary for testing

To manipulate a variable real time from the dashboard use Dashboard.getInputValue([Caption]); this returns a float.

To use logging/telemetry make an instance of dashboardtelemetry and use write([message]);


The the code for the computer side of the dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/Team11260/FTCDashboard).

The inspiration as well as the base for the ClasspathScanner/ClassFilter are from team 8367 ACME Robotics, their web based version can be found [here](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard).

More documentation coming soon!
